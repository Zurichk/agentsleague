## 💡 Project Ideas

In this track, we encourage you to build creative applications that demonstrate the power of AI-assisted development with GitHub Copilot. We especially welcome [Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/install-copilot-cli) / [Copilot CLI SDK](https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk) tools and MCP server integrations! Here are some categories and ideas to inspire your project:

### Content Generation

Build applications that create, transform, or enhance creative content:

- **Story Generator**: An AI-powered narrative engine that creates interactive fiction, short stories, or personalized bedtime stories based on user prompts and preferences
- **Music Composer**: A tool that creates melodies, chord progressions, or full musical arrangements
- **Script Writer**: An assistant for creating screenplays, dialogue, or theatrical scripts

### Visual Creativity

Develop tools that enable visual expression and design:

- **Design Assistant**: A tool that helps users create logos, color palettes, layouts, or design mockups
- **Image Manipulation Tool**: An application for creative photo editing, filters, or artistic transformations
- **ASCII Art Generator**: Convert images or text into creative ASCII or Unicode art

### Game Development

Create playful, interactive experiences:

- **Puzzle Generator**: Applications that create unique puzzles, riddles, or brain teasers
- **Game Asset Creator**: Tools for generating sprites, textures, or game dialogue

### Creative Productivity

Build tools that enhance creative workflows:

- **Content Remixer**: Transform existing content into new formats, styles, or mediums for various platforms
- **Idea Brainstormer**: An application that generates creative ideas, prompts, or concepts for writers, artists, or designers

### Interactive Experiences

Craft engaging, conversational, or immersive applications:

- **Character Chatbot**: Create conversational agents with unique personalities, backstories, or expertise
- **Educational Games**: Interactive learning experiences that make education engaging and fun

Feel free to combine categories, invent entirely new concepts, or explore areas not listed here. **There are no restrictions on application type or technology stack — web, CLI, mobile, desktop, embedded, VR/AR, and more are all welcome!**

> 💡 **Build for GitHub Copilot**: Consider building MCP servers that integrate directly with GitHub Copilot in VS Code or Copilot CLI! Your MCP server can expose tools and data sources that Copilot can use during chat conversations, making your solution available to developers right where they work. See the [MCP in VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers) for how to connect MCP servers to Copilot.

VS Code is lightweight (< 200 MB download) and ships monthly releases with auto-update support.

> **Note:** If you choose to use VS Code Insiders, you will have access to the latest features but you may encounter occasional instability.

### Step 2: Install Additional Components

Install development tools based on your project needs:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for JavaScript/TypeScript development
- Language runtimes for Python, Java, Go, or other languages you plan to use

See the full list of [additional components](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/additional-components).

### Step 3: Install VS Code Extensions

Customize VS Code with extensions from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode):

- Formatters
- Language extensions and debuggers
- Tools for your favorite frameworks

### Step 4: Enable AI Features with GitHub Copilot
